Here is a detailed phased checklist for **Developer 2** focusing on the backend analytics, AI integration, aggregation, insights, anomaly detection, and rewards (no frontend):

***

## Developer 2 Backend Phase Map and Checklist

### Phase 1: Data Access Layer

- [x] Establish secure API or direct DB read access to Supabase (using existing `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`).
- [x] Build efficient SQL queries, views, or materialized views for:
  - Fetching `bin_events` by `bin_id` and `user_id`.
  - Aggregating event metrics.
- [x] Verify access control aligning with RLS policies.

### Phase 2: Aggregation & Metrics Computation

- [x] Implement scheduled backend jobs (cron or workers) to aggregate:
  - Daily/weekly HV/LV/ORG counts per bin and host.
  - Weights, fill levels, and other metrics.
  - Compute revenue estimations (apply price tables).
- [x] Store aggregates in dedicated tables or materialized views for fast querying.

### Phase 3: AI Integration with OpenXAI Xnode

- [x] Integrate with OpenXAI Xnode API:
  - Prepare event data batches for AI processing.
  - Send classification, purity scoring, and anomaly detection requests asynchronously.
  - Receive AI results and parse/validate responses.
- [x] Design and create storage schema for AI results (`ai_insights` or extended event fields).

### Phase 4: Anomaly Detection & Fraud Flags

- [x] Implement rule-based and AI-based anomaly detection logic.
- [x] Store detected anomalies in an `anomalies` table with severity, type, and relevant metadata.
- [x] Build APIs or DB views to retrieve anomaly information for hosts and operators.

### Phase 5: Rewards & Achievement Ledger

- [x] Define earnings and points calculation logic based on analytics and AI scoring.
- [x] Populate `rewards_ledger` and `badges_ledger` tables with computed incentives.
- [x] Schedule regular jobs to update and maintain rewards state per host/bin.

### Phase 6: Analytics APIs & Data Serving

- [x] Develop backend APIs to serve:
  - User/host stats and earnings.
  - AI insights (classification, purity, suggestions).
  - Anomaly reports.
  - Leaderboards and gamification info.
- [x] Document API schema and usage for frontend or integration.

### Phase 7: Monitoring & Reliability

- [x] Implement logging and monitoring of all analytics and AI processing jobs.
- [x] Set up alerts for job failures, data freshness, or inconsistent results.
- [x] Optimize performance for query speed and job execution.

### Phase 8: Documentation & Collaboration

- [x] Document all analytics data models, pipelines, and APIs.
- [x] Collaborate with Developer 1 to sync data expectations, update triggers, and coordinate schema changes.
- [x] Maintain clear versioning and changelogs for analytics components.

This roadmap ensures Developer 2 builds a robust, scalable, AI-enhanced analytics backend working seamlessly atop Developer 1's ingestion and user/bin management foundation.
