# Developer 1 Backend Phase Map

| Phase | Name                         | Description                                                                                  | Key Deliverables                                  |
|-------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Supabase Setup & Configuration | Setup project in Supabase; configure environment and keys; initialize project repository.     | Supabase project created; env vars configured    |
| 2     | Database Schema Design         | Design and create tables: users/profiles, bins, bin_events with relations and constraints     | Tables and migrations created                     |
| 3     | Authentication & Authorization | Integrate Supabase Auth; set up user roles (host, operator); implement row-level security     | Auth flows working; RLS enforcing access roles   |
| 4     | User & Host Registration       | Build APIs/UI for managing host user creation and roles; ensure secure registration flow      | User onboarding API/UI                            |
| 5     | Smart Bin Registration & Allocation | Create APIs/UI to register bins, assign bins to hosts, manage bin metadata and statuses       | Bin registration and assignment APIs/UI          |
| 6     | Device Credential Management   | Generate, store and manage API keys or tokens per bin/device with insert-only access scopes   | Secure keys generation and assignment             |
| 7     | Data Ingestion Pipeline        | Enable bins to write event JSONs directly into `bin_events`, with validation and error handling | Reliable ingestion with input validation          |
| 8     | RLS Testing & Verification     | Verify row-level security policies for all roles; simulate access scenarios                   | Tested data access enforcement                     |
| 9     | Logging, Monitoring & Alerting | Implement logging for user/bin creation and event writes; setup alerts for ingestion failures | Logs created; alert system operational            |
| 10    | Documentation                  | Document schemas, APIs, security policies, onboarding procedures, and environment setup       | Developer and operator documentation completed    |

This phase map ensures the full backend platform for data storage, user and bin lifecycle management, and event ingestion is reliably built for your smart-bin project.
